TODO
Musts:
- Scenery
	- Randomly generate spawn location and camp location
	- Add logic to PCG_Forest graph to not spawn trees for certain areas (spawn location and camp location)
	- Add dead animal at spawn location
	- Footprints:
		- Add second foot to footprints, 
		- Add procedural generated spline for footprints
			- make 3/4 splines all intertwining with each other. Maybe some sort of sin waves?
	- Sound:
		- Add ambient wind/trees sound above player
		- Add distance animals/insects sounds
		- Add persistent hide-behinds that will make noises and disapear when getting too close
			- maybe other distant moving figures as well. silent might be creepy too?

- Darkness meter:
	- make simple to show meter
	- meter value will go up when not near your pack
	- when it hits certain values, add more visual effects on screen and creepy audio cues
		- maybe have the hide-behinds and creatures start spawning closer as value increases
		- torches get dimmer as value increases
		- creepy indistinguishable noises as value increases

- NPCs
	- Use or create better model, use animations from mixamo

- Title screen
	- simple picture with title and start button

- Start sequence
	- UI/sound prompts in begining to add context

- End game
	- UI/sound/gameplay prompts at arrive of camp to indicate you're safe. Maybe sun comes up?

Nice to haves:
- Fix texture streaming max error (need to compress textures to a lower res)
